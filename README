| SEGA SATURN HITACHI SUPERH SH-2 GCC C COMPILER |

|OVERVIEW|
This is an optimised version of the GCC C compiler for Hitachi SuperH SH-2
microprocessors.

|BUILDING|
Currently, only GNU/Linux and Windows are actively supported as build targets.
Other operating systems may work with modification to the build files.  If you
have made changes to build on a non-supported operating system, please use
GitHub to make a pull request.  All new build platforms are very much
appreciated.

Mac OS X is supported by way of Misty De Meo.

In order to successfully build GCC, the following environment variables need
to be defined:
export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/source
export BUILDDIR=$(pwd)/build
export TARGETMACH=sh-elf
export BUILDMACH=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
export HOSTMACH=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
export INSTALLDIR=$(pwd)/toolchain
export SYSROOTDIR=$INSTALLDIR/sysroot
export ROOTDIR=$(pwd)
export DOWNLOADDIR=$(pwd)/download
export PROGRAM_PREFIX=saturn-sh2-

PROGRAM_PREFIX is the prefix used before the tool's name, such as:
saturn-sh2-gcc, where gcc is the program, with saturn-sh2- being the prefix.
BUILDMACH is the development machine the compiler will run on.

The HOSTMACH is the system architecture the compiler will run on, while the
TARGETMARCH is the architecture the program or library created from the Saturn
SH-2 compilerwill run on.

BUILDMACH is used for cross-compiling, set it to the current machine's build
architecture, and the HOSTMACH to the platform the generated compiler will run
on.  When not cross-compiling, set both HOSTMACH and BUILDMACH to the same
value.

Depending on the operating system the compiler is built on, additional tools
may be required.  For cross-compiling for Windows, MinGW-w64 (i686 or x86_64)
will be required on GNU/Linux systems.

There are no Windows batch files for compilation of the compiler on a native
Windows install.  MSYS with MinGW-w64 or Cygwin may work, though they have not
been tested.

SKIP_DOWNLOAD can be set to any string to skip the call to `download.sh`, for
example if the dependency tarballs have already been downloaded using something
else.
